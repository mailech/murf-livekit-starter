"""Day 4: memory that survives a restart.

One table, one row per student. The agent reaches this only through tools —
never through the prompt — so what it remembers is auditable and can be deleted
on request.

Track: Learning & Literacy, so the facts worth keeping are the ones that change
how you teach someone next time:

    level            -- beginner / intermediate / advanced, in their words
    topics_covered   -- what we have already been through
    weak_spots       -- mistakes they keep repeating (the most useful of all)
    language         -- which language they prefer to be taught in

Deliberately NOT stored: anything that is not about learning. No phone number,
no school, no address, no marks. A CS tutor has no business holding those.

THREADING NOTE — this is the whole reason for the structure below.

asyncpg resolves hostnames via `loop.getaddrinfo`, which runs on the event
loop's DEFAULT executor. LiveKit shuts that executor down during a job, so any
connection opened afterwards dies with "Executor shutdown has been called".

Replacing the loop's default executor looks like the fix. It is not: LiveKit's
own Deepgram STT and aiohttp share that executor, so substituting ours made the
microphone fail mid-call with "cannot schedule new futures after shutdown" and
killed the session unrecoverably.

So the database runs on its own event loop, on its own daemon thread. Its
executor belongs to us, nothing else uses it, and LiveKit's lifecycle cannot
reach it. The agent awaits results across the thread boundary as normal.
