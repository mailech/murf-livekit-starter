"""Day 8: did the call actually work?

SUCCESS, for this agent, means the student walked away with something concrete.
Taken straight from the Day 2 objectives, narrowed until it is measurable:

    a concept was taught   -- code or a flowchart went on their screen
    a problem was given    -- a real Codeforces exercise to attempt
    a human was found      -- an escalation was filed for them

Any one of those and the call succeeded. A warm chat where nothing was learned
did not.

Deciding this in CODE rather than asking the model to grade itself matters. A
model asked "did that go well?" says yes almost every time, and a dashboard
built on that flatters you instead of informing you. These three signals are
side effects of tools actually firing, so they cannot be talked into existence.

A failed call is not a crash. Usually it means the student left before getting
anywhere, which is worth knowing.

Privacy: no transcript, no phone number, no content of any kind. Counters,
timings and an outcome. Nothing here would embarrass a student if it leaked.
